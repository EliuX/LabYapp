## Synopsis

In 2014 I was also involved in the development of a Mobile application called “LabpYapp”. This was a mobile application for a small business health solutions called "ConSuSalud", located in Cali, Colombia. Its main mission was the promotion of services related to clinical investigations and the reservation of appointments. Was created in CodeNameOne, due to the possibilities for the deployment of native applications on Android, iOS, Symbian, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, among others. Unfortunately this business was dismantled.
Here there are some pictures about it:
